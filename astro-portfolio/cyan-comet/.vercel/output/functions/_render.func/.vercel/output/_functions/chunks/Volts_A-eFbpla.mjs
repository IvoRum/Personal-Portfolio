In essencs it is my masters thessis.\r\nHere's a polished description for your portfolio website, focusing on your master's thesis:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Monitoring System for Industrial and Business Applications\r\n\r\nThis project presents the **design and development of a monitoring system** that enables real-time data collection, processing, and analysis for industrial and business environments. The system is built on **modern software engineering principles** and leverages **microservices architecture, automation, and cloud integration** to ensure scalability, flexibility, and efficiency.\r\n\r\nKey aspects of the project include:\r\n\r\n- **Microservices Architecture:** Implemented with **Spring Boot**, ensuring modularity, scalability, and easy maintenance.\r\n- **Real-Time Data Processing:** The system collects and analyzes resource consumption data (electricity, water, gas) to optimize operational efficiency. The data collection works by using **Modbus-compatible devices**. The system has been tested using a **Siemens Sentron** electric meter.\r\n- **Secure and Scalable Infrastructure:** Built with **containerized deployment**, CI/CD pipelines, and **authentication layers** for enhanced security.\r\n- **User-Friendly Interface:** Developed using **React** and integrated with a powerful API for seamless data visualization and reporting.\r\n- **Automated Workflows:** Leveraging **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment and system monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis project provides a **reliable and adaptable** monitoring solution, applicable across various industries, optimizing resource usage and improving decision-making through **data-driven insights**.\r\n\r\n![Electricity page](/projects/volts/electricity_page_2.png)\r\n\r\nWeb interface running on local host.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n![Graph representation of db](/projects/volts/DB_as_graph.png)\r\n\r\nGraph representation of the data base.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<video width=\"100%\" controls>\r\n  <source src=\"/projects/volts/reading_nomally.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\r\n</video>\r\n\r\nVideo demo of the connecting system reading date from the factory and sending it to the main monitoring system.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n[devlob #1](/blog/fusinon360/)\r\n[devlob #2](/blog/spring-pipeline/)\r\n[Volts Repo](https://github.com/100volts)\r\n";
