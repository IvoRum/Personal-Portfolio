The essence of a GDD is to help you make more games by writing down the functionalities of a game you’re planning to create. It guides you to <strong>actually</strong> build a game instead of just <strong>fantasizing</strong> about what it might look like—you end up playing it! This got me thinking: what if we applied the same approach to software development? So, I decided to implement this mindset in my one-week challenge, where I created a software design document to outline the foundation on which my software would be built.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-software-design-document\">What is a Software Design Document?</h3>\n<p>If you’re into software development—and you probably are if you’re reading this—you may have heard of software documentation, where developers write documentation alongside the code. A Software Design Document (SDD) is somewhat similar. It is a written explanation of what the software is, its guidelines, and where it will be used. Think of it like a big Jira ticket, describing the problem and the solution. That’s the gist of it. An SDD can also include information about the developers involved, and sometimes, even the style guide for UI/UX designers. Although the style guide is not always considered part of the SDD, I include it because the visual style remains a constant element throughout the software.I have create my own template you cancel check out <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAGSyNzy9cY/VOXdFMK7TcYaUbzCg_4gDQ/view?utm_content=DAGSyNzy9cY&#x26;utm_campaign=designshare&#x26;utm_medium=link&#x26;utm_source=publishsharelink&#x26;mode=preview\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/sdd/sdd_template.png\" alt=\"Sdd template\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"why-write-an-sdd\">Why Write an SDD?</h3>\n<p>Why should developers bother writing an SDD? First, an SDD helps set milestones for completing the software. It allows you to see the start and end of the project, helping you and your team plan the implementation strategy. An SDD is especially useful when working with clients, as it can prevent budget overruns due to unspecified issues or functionalities. But what I want to focus on is how an SDD can help with your personal software side projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dev-development-and-learning-cool-stuff\">Dev, Development, and Learning Cool Stuff</h3>\n<p>If you’re a developer and aspire to be a “10x developer,” you need experience in everything. However, your education or job might not cover everything you want to know about development. That’s where side projects come into play. Every developer I know has worked on side projects to learn new technologies, development stacks, or whatever they’re interested in. Once the skill is acquired, though, most devs forget about those projects. Repeating this process for new skills helps you gain experience quickly. Unfortunately, many developers stop doing side projects after landing a comfortable corporate job. But if you want to keep learning, an SDD can shorten your learning curve significantly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-build-an-sdd\">How to Build an SDD</h3>\n<p>To show you how to build an SDD, I’ll walk you through my one-month project to learn Go syntax as a side project. When I start a project, I go over a quick checklist to estimate how long it will take. If it’s not fitting my schedule, I start cutting unnecessary functionalities early. Trust me, this saves a lot of time in planning, development, and implementation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a Goal/Problem</strong>: Describe your use case and think about the end goal.</li>\n<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Consider existing solutions to similar problems.

The key is to write down what you want and iterate on it until it works as expected. I highly recommend using the ABCDE method—it’s a fantastic tool.

For me, the colors associated with software are key.

However, this post isn’t about color theory—I’ll revisit that topic in a future post on branding. Still, picking a color palette that suits your software’s concept is important.
