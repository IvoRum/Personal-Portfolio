Mindzone is designed to support [DXC](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dxc-technology-bulgaria/posts/?feedView=all) representatives during various events. It engages the audience in a fun and interactive way while simultaneously collecting valuable feedback to assist the HR department. The app offers a variety of games that can be adapted to different age groups through adjustable difficulty settings. Additionally, the ability to maintain multiple survey templates allows for the selection of the most suitable one based on the audience's profile.

The application was developed as part of a [DXC](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dxc-technology-bulgaria/posts/?feedView=all) hackathon that spanned two months. During this time, my colleagues [Boyan Boyanov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyan-boyanov-3b673b21a/) and [Darina Staevska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darinastaevska/) and I collaborated to design, build, and test the application. The front end was built using **React.js** with **Vite**, while the back end was developed with **Spring Boot**.
