# Introduction

Hello to hue ever is reading dis. This is the start of a tradition that I what to continue. And it is to write a dev log after every mielstone in a project. In esence it slows down the process of development. But it helps tramensly in retrospective and finding out what whent rong and not to repeat the misstake. So from now on I`l stive to create a dev log at every milestone and at least evary month if the mile stone is vary far.

# What is Fusion 360 and why use it

So Fusion 360 is a CAD softuare. And a vary easy to use CAD software. In the past I have used Blender for all of my 3d modaling need. However when it comes to specific mesaraments its laking in my opinion. If you whant to use Blender for a replesment of a profesional CAD software just dont. Blender is maly used for creativ 3d model, consept renders, animations and meny more.

So why em I using Fusion 360 for? Whell its for a box that will house my mini coputer for the 100Volts project. This box will house a small single board computer (SBC) that will stand as a connector betwayn the main server and the customers factory premicis.
