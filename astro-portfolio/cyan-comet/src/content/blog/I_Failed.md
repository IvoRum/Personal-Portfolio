Hello everyone, I’m sorry to let you down, but I failed. However, I learned a lot in the process. To catch you all up, I created a challenge for myself where, for one week, I would design, program, and deploy a software. Well, things didn’t go as planned. I did, however, manage to design the software, write some pseudocode, and create a database layer for persistence. But before I dive into the details of what was done, let me first share how even a well-thought-out plan can go sideways.

This project started as a fun challenge to test what I’ve learned over the past summer, during which I built my personal energy tracking software, Volts. I had some downtime while waiting for my university to approve the software, so I decided to create a small app for managing and altering dynamic brackets. But on just the second day, my thesis was approved. With that good news came a lot of paperwork, which took two days to complete, alongside my regular work. I’m not complaining in the slightest—just sharing the experience of Bulgarian universities.

Despite the setbacks, I did manage to create a cool-looking [Style Guide](https://dribbble.com/shots/25013077-Game-Bracket-Manager-Style-Guide), which I uploaded to my Dribbble account. That’s a plus because I tend to spend a lot of time on style guides for my projects. Even Volts still doesn’t have a finished style guide.

Overall, this challenge was humbling. It showed me how far I’ve come in my ability to design something, and I had fun setting up the pseudocode and logic, even just on paper. I highly recommend it—if you’re feeling burned out or tired of your job or project, try designing something just for fun. Let your creativity flow. I guarantee that after a creative burst, you’ll return to your day-to-day tasks feeling refreshed and recharged.

Thank you for reading. I know I disappointed some of you, but I promise to make it up to you in my next post.
