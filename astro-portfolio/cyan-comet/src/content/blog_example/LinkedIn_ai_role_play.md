# Introduction

So I`v had a interest in using ai in real world problems from day one. And most of the solutions so far like Ai art generation or Ai speatch generation are just creapy and I personaly feel that they take away from what people like to do. So I'm allaws searching for a way to use IA in a createve wey but not to take allaw from what people like to and what people are ment to do like the arts, education and ets. And when I share my AI experiences I whant to show you cool things to do whit AI but not to take away form what we like to do. And after testing out Linked in's Ai role play I was hood from ouwer first sesion.

# What is Linked In Ai role play

In esens you tell the AI to pretend to be somthing and it will do its best to role play as that somthing. English is not my first lenguage so ofcourse my interpretation of this fiture mey be slanted. However I`m truelu thankfull for this type of tool to be used to better myself. Menly I used the role play AI so that I can practise being intervield in enlish. Witch if you whant to train with a real persont. This is hard. Harder the you mith think. First he needs to know enlisht (Im not in a primarily enlish speking contry and not all but the mojority of interview questins and not in english) and he must be of a hight knolage level and its a bonus if he knws the trinks this interviers pull. So thats where the Ai comes int play. Doing a interview it whit a AI role play robot is actual quet a plesent way to learn. It dosent get andgry at you and it will weit for you to answere. Witch in moset intervers have short tampers due to most interviees tend to stall for time when they dont know a questin. I get it but dont be rude. Well joks asight here is my experiens whit the AI role plaing a sinior Java Spring intevier.
