### Monitoring System for Industrial and Business Applications

This project presents the **design and development of a monitoring system** that enables real-time data collection, processing, and analysis for industrial and business environments. The system is built on **modern software engineering principles** and leverages **microservices architecture, automation, and cloud integration** to ensure scalability, flexibility, and efficiency.

Key aspects of the project include:

- **Microservices Architecture:** Implemented with **Spring Boot**, ensuring modularity, scalability, and easy maintenance.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** The system collects and analyzes resource consumption data (electricity, water, gas) to optimize operational efficiency. The data collection works by using **Modbus-compatible devices**. The system has been tested using a **Siemens Sentron** electric meter.
- **Secure and Scalable Infrastructure:** Built with **containerized deployment**, CI/CD pipelines, and **authentication layers** for enhanced security.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Developed using **React** and integrated with a powerful API for seamless data visualization and reporting.
- **Automated Workflows:** Leveraging **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment and system monitoring.

This project provides a **reliable and adaptable** monitoring solution, applicable across various industries, optimizing resource usage and improving decision-making through **data-driven insights**.
